# IoT Data Streaming & Modified Clustering Algorithm

This repository contains three major components:  

1. **IoT Sensor Timeseries Dataset (DHT11 and ESP32)**  
2. **Python Implementation of the Modified Clustering Algorithm** (optimized for real-time IoT data streams)  
3. **IoT Data Streaming Simulator** for generating and testing live sensor data streams  

Together, these components provide a complete framework for **collecting, simulating, storing, and analyzing IoT timeseries data**.

## 1. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of time-series records collected from IoT sensors (DHT11 + ESP32) monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity.  

Each document includes:  

- **time_stamp**: The date and time the reading was recorded.  
- **hum**: Humidity value recorded by the DHT11 sensor (percentage).  
- **temp**: Temperature value recorded by the DHT11 sensor (Â°C).  
- **device_id**: Unique identifier for each device.  
- **location**: Location of the device (e.g., `faculty_house`, `laboratory`).  
- **_id**: Unique object identifier (OID) generated by MongoDB.  

### Sample Data Document

```json
{
  "time_stamp": {
    "$date": "2024-05-28T14:21:11.014Z"
  },
  "hum": 20,
  "device_id": "D06",
  "location": "faculty_house",
  "temp": 36,
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "66559aff1320d29dc89904ed"
  }
}
```

## 2. Modified Algorithm (Python Code)

The repository includes Python code for a **Modified Clustering Algorithm**, designed specifically for **real-time IoT data analysis**.  

### Features:
- Handles **continuous IoT data streams** efficiently.  
- Supports **dynamic cluster updates** as new data arrives.  
- Optimized for **low-latency and memory-efficient performance** in streaming environments.  
- Benchmark-ready with IoT datasets included in this repository.  

### Running the Algorithm

```bash
python modified_algorithm.py --dataset dataset/data.txt --mode stream
```

Parameters:  
- `--dataset`: Path to the dataset file.  
- `--mode`: Either `stream` for live streaming or `batch` for offline analysis.

## 3. IoT Data Streaming Simulator

To test the modified algorithm under real-world conditions, the repository also includes an **IoT Data Streaming Simulator**.  

### Capabilities:
- Simulates **real-time sensor readings** (temperature & humidity).  
- Generates a **continuous data feed** that mimics IoT device behavior.  
- Can push data to **MongoDB**, files, or direct pipeline into the clustering algorithm.  

### Usage

```bash
python iot_stream_simulator.py --interval 2 --output mongo
```

Parameters:  
- `--interval`: Interval between sensor readings (in seconds).  
- `--output`: `mongo`, `file`, or `stdout` (for pipeline testing).

## 4. Why MongoDB?

MongoDB is used as the backend database for IoT data storage:  

- **Schema Flexibility**: Adaptable to evolving IoT sensor formats.  
- **Optimized for Timeseries**: Fast ingestion and retrieval of timestamped data.  
- **Scalability**: Handles continuous streams from multiple IoT devices.  
- **BSON Storage**: Naturally aligns with JSON-like IoT data structures.  

---

## 5. Applications

This repository can be used for:  
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracking humidity/temperature patterns.  
- **Streaming Analytics**: Real-time clustering of IoT sensor data.  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual environmental or device behaviors.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting future sensor trends for proactive decision-making.

## 6. How to Use

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
   cd <repo>
   ```
2. Run the **IoT simulator** to generate live data.  
3. Use the **modified algorithm** to process and analyze streams.  
4. Store, query, and visualize the dataset using **MongoDB** or Python visualization libraries.
