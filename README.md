# IoT Sensor Timeseries Dataset (DHT11 and ESP32)

This repository contains a timeseries dataset collected from IoT sensors (DHT11 and ESP32) monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The data is stored in an unstructured database, **MongoDB**, enabling flexible data handling and efficient timeseries data storage.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes records from multiple sensors distributed across various locations. Each entry captures the following information:

- **time_stamp**: The date and time the reading was recorded.
- **hum**: Humidity value recorded by the DHT11 sensor (percentage).
- **temp**: Temperature value recorded by the DHT11 sensor (Celsius).
- **device_id**: Unique identifier for each device.
- **location**: Location of the device (e.g., `faculty_house`, `laboratory`, etc.).
- **_id**: Unique object identifier (OID) automatically generated by MongoDB.

### Sample Data Document

```json
{
  "time_stamp": {
    "$date": "2024-05-28T14:21:11.014Z"
  },
  "hum": 20,
  "device_id": "D06",
  "location": "faculty_house",
  "temp": 36,
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "66559aff1320d29dc89904ed"
  }
}
```

## Why MongoDB?

MongoDB, as a NoSQL database, is particularly suited for handling unstructured data, making it an ideal choice for IoT data collection. Here’s why:

- **Schema Flexibility**: IoT data can vary in structure, depending on device type, sensor readings, or location. MongoDB’s flexible schema allows new data fields to be added without altering the entire dataset structure.
- **Efficient Timeseries Handling**: MongoDB is optimized for timeseries data storage, making it ideal for storing timestamped records. Its performance benefits, particularly for data retrieval and aggregation, enable efficient handling of large volumes of IoT data.
- **Scalability**: As IoT devices generate continuous streams of data, MongoDB provides horizontal scaling options that allow the database to expand with the dataset.
- **JSON-like Storage**: MongoDB stores data in a BSON (Binary JSON) format, which aligns well with JSON data, commonly used in IoT devices, making data insertion straightforward.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Accessing the Data**: Clone the repository and load the sample dataset for analysis.
2. **Visualizing Timeseries Data**: Use Python, R, or another data visualization tool to analyze trends over time, locations, and device variations.
3. **Connecting to MongoDB**: Load the dataset into your own MongoDB instance by inserting documents or collections directly.

## Applications

This dataset can be used for various applications, including:

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track temperature and humidity patterns in different locations.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify abnormal patterns that may indicate device malfunctions or environmental changes.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Use historical data to forecast future conditions and enable proactive decision-making.
